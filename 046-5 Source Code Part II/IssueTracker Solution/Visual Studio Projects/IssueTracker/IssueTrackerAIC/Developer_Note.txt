Note: This project depends upon a COM reference to "Microsoft BizTalk Server 
Application Interface Component 1.0 Type Library". If you do not have this 
library installed (via BizTalk Server installation) then this project will
not compile, resulting in the whole solution not compiling. Therefore, 
this project is marked as not compiled for both Debug and Release projects. To
enable compilation, select Build->Configuration Manager from the menu and
check the IssueTrackerAIC entry.
